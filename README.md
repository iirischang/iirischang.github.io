## Typography & Interaction Projects (2024-2025)
Hi, Iâ€™m Iris. Welcome to my collection of projects created for the Typography & Interaction class at Parsons School of Design (2024-2025).
<br>
This repository showcases five distinct projects, each exploring the relationship between typography and interaction through creative coding. The projects are structured and styled using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, focusing on visually representing textual concepts while adding interactive elements inspired by relevant articles and themes.
