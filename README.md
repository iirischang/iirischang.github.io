## [Typography & Interaction Projects (2024-2025)](https://typography-interaction-2425.github.io/)  
Hi, Iâ€™m Iris. Welcome to my collection of projects created for the [**Typography & Interaction**](https://typography-interaction-2425.github.io/) class at Parsons School of Design (2024-2025).  
<br>  
This repository showcases five distinct projects, each exploring the relationship between typography and interaction through creative coding. The projects are structured and styled using **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**, focusing on visually representing textual concepts while adding interactive elements inspired by relevant articles and themes.

*Thank you for checking out my project!*  ðŸ«¡
